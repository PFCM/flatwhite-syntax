Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries *Vokalia* and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the code of the *Semantics*, a large language ocean.
And here is a [link](https://atom.io/themes/flatwhite-syntax)
just for you. Now lets go over to some **quotes** and __citations__:

## On Rivers of Words
### First part

As somebody said in the book:

> "But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long  until a few insidious *Copy Writers* ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again."^[@test This is a footnote, p.22]

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);

### A heading
She packed her seven *versalia*, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown *Bookmarksgrove*, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. Another quote:

> "The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild *Question Marks* and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen."

#### Important paragraph
Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A bold **river** named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. ~~Here is some stroked text.~~
The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.
